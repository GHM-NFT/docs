# GHM NFT Strategy — Handover Packet (v1)

**Project:** Gods Heroes Myths (GHM)  
**Aesthetic:** 70s/80s cinematic sword‑and‑sandal (Clash of the Titans / Jason and the Argonauts)  
**Canonical license_url:** https://moda.digital/ghm-white-paper/

## Concept (first‑time reader)
GHM is a chaptered myth library, not random NFTs. Each artwork is a scene (chapter) inside larger narrative arcs (collections/sagas).

> Collect a chapter (or Saga Pass), unlock story/utility, and watch the world expand across cultures through Atlas previews.

## Products
### Achilles and the War of Troy — Collection Two
- 14 chapters (Ch01–Ch14)
- Optional Box Set / Saga Pass (bundles access to all chapters)
- Consistent naming: long poster title + short marketplace title + stable slug

### Atlas Teasers
- 1 keystone 1/1 per culture (ETH)
- Visible early to show the expanse; unlisted until the culture season opens

### GHM Passport (stamps)
- Base 1155 stamps per culture/saga for allowlists, perks, and airdrops

## Marketplaces & chains
- **OpenSea:** primary for most supply (especially editions)
- **Rarible:** selected hero-story spotlights (art‑centric)
- **ETH / ERC‑721:** 1/1s (Atlas Teasers, optional Director’s Cut)
- **Base / ERC‑1155:** chapters, Saga Pass, stamps, relics

## Non‑negotiables
- Stable slugs and stable external URLs (Story Hub)
- Symbols split into multiple traits
- license_url + license_attr_value on every token
- operator_filter=on
